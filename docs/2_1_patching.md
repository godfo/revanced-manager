# üß© Patching apps

Learn how to use ReVanced Manager to patch apps.

## ‚úÖ Steps to patch apps

1. Navigate to the **Patcher** tab from the bottom navigation bar
2. Tap on the **Select an app** card
3. Choose an app to patch[^1]

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note  
   > The suggested version is visible on each app's card.  
   > You can tap on it to open a search query to obtain an APK file for the selected app with the suggested version

   > üí° Tip  
   > If you are prompted to select an APK file from storage because the selected app is a split APK, tap on the "Suggested version" label to open a search query to obtain said APK file

4. Tap on the **Select patches** card and select the patches you want to apply[^2].

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note  
   > Some patches have options that can or must be configured by tapping on ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to the patch name.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning  
   > If you see a warning, you can click on it for more information.

5. Tap on the **Done** then **Patch** button

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning  
   > The patching process may take ~5 minutes. Exiting the app may cancel patching or significantly increase the time it takes to patch.

6. Tap on the **Install** button

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note  
   > If you are rooted, you can mount[^3] the patched app on top of the original app.[^4]
   > Optionally, you may export the patched app to storage using the option in the bottom left corner.

[^1]: You can select installed apps from the list of installed apps or APK files from device storage. ReVanced does not provide any APK files, so you must source them yourself.
[^2]: It is suggested to use the default set of patches by tapping on the **Default** button above the list of patches.
[^3]: Mounting refers to using Linux's mounting mechanism to layer the patched app on top of the existing installed app.
[^4]: Mounting the patched app on top of the original app may only work if the installed app version matches the version of the app selected in step 3. above.
